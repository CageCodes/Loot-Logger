# CoX and ToB loot tracker

Due to the nature of looting and splits in PvM the RuneLite loot tracker is not accurate for drops nor does it store pricing at time of loot.
We wanted to come up with a solution to this for higher accuracy and eliminating as much manual entry as possible.

* If an item price is not updating, force an update by running the Runescape Price Updater script located on the menu bar
